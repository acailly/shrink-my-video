The following patch has been applied to serve FFMPEG.WASM locally:

https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm/issues/166#issuecomment-794615598

```
- Download https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg@0.9.6/dist/ffmpeg.min.js locally
- Edited the file and replaced the string https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/core@ with ./
- Made a directory called 0.8.5 and moved ffmpeg.min.js into it.
- Made 0.8.5/dist/ and retrieved 3 linked files into it:
  - https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/core@0.8.5/dist/ffmpeg-core.js
  - https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/core@0.8.5/dist/ffmpeg-core.worker.js
  - https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/core@0.8.5/dist/ffmpeg-core.wasm
```

It is a workaround for the following issues:
